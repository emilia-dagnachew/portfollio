				fundamental skills of outdoor survival such as camping, emergency first aid, and outdoor cooking. These
				activities aim to build character, physical fitness, and internalize the Scout Oath and Scout Law values

			<p> High School Night is a coming-of-age event with two goals: first, help students prepare for young
				adulthood by bringing all of them together to practice the good social graces and etiquette in a formal
				setting. Second, here is when grade ten students formally pass their responsibility as leaders of junior
				high to the next generation of grade ten leaders.
			<h1 style="font-family:Trattatello, fantasy"> 12. Academic Contest </h1>
			<p> SFAMSC holds an annual Academic competition from preschool to grade 10 as an opportunity for students to
				further deepen their knowledge in fundamental subjects like math and science. These contests are
				designed to inspire students to study and enjoy the thrill of competition!
			<h1 style="font-family:Trattatello, fantasy"> 13. Musical-Literary Contests </h1>
			<p> The Musical-Literary Contest aims to bring out the non-academic talents of students through public
				performances such as song, dance, and poetry. Usually, shy and quiet students are encouraged to join to
				show the world their hidden talents. Public performances build self-esteem and increase confidence.
			<h1> style="font-family:Trattatello, fantasy" 14. Foundation Day </h1>
			<p> We commemorate the foundation of our school every end of January. We celebrate by having fun activities
				such as a talent show, field demos, fundraising games by the parent councils, and a school bazaar
