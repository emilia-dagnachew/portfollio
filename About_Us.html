			<p> I am a student at Trillium International School, and will be in 9th grade as of 2023.I am learning
				coding which is why I has created this site. Though I am still learning, my website has come a long way.
			<h2> My Goal </h2>
			<p> My personal goal is to develop a website that is fun for all users, and for them to really be interested
				while going through my website. I did not write the contents in the website, but in the future when I
				develop one myself, I will probably write recipes. Maybe have my own little cooking and baking website.
				Well until then, here is "my" website.
			<h2> My hobbies </h2>
			<p> Whenever I get bored, I feel like cracking out a sketch book and either painting or just sketching. When
				I get sick of that, I read fiction books. At the moment I am reading Betrayed. Another thing I like
				doing is baking. I have made many desserts over the years like snicker doodles, cakes, fruit tart, sugar
				cookies, chocolate chip cookies, and more. I especially enjoy baking when its a new recipe to me or it
				is a challenge to make.
			<p> Not that long ago, we got a vollyball, and I kinda love vollyball so that's nice. I play frequently with
				my fam, and I used to play in my old old school.
