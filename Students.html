			<h1> Teaching is a difficult job. The ultimate reward is knowing that you have the opportunity to have an
				impact on a young person’s life. However, not every student is created equal. Most teachers will tell
				you that they don’t have favorites, but the truth is that there are students who possess certain
				characteristics that make them ideal pupils. These students are naturally endearing to teachers, and it
				is difficult not to embrace them because they make your job easier. Read on to discover the 10 traits
				all great students possess. </h1>
			<h2> They Ask Questions </h2>
			<p> Most teachers want students to ask questions when they do not understand a concept that is being taught.
				It is truly the only way a teacher knows whether you really understand something. If no questions are
				asked, then the teacher has to assume that you understood that concept. Good students aren’t afraid to
				ask questions because they know that if they do not get a particular concept, it could hurt them later
				on when that skill is expanded. Asking questions is often beneficial to the class as a whole because
				chances are if you have that question, there are other students who have that same question.
			<h2> They're Hard Workers </h2>
			<p> The perfect student isn’t necessarily the smartest student. There are plenty of students who are blessed
				with natural intelligence but lack the self-discipline to hone that intelligence. Teachers love students
				who choose to work hard no matter what their level of intelligence is. The hardest working students will
				ultimately be the most successful in life. Being a hard worker in school means completing assignments on
				time, putting your maximum effort into every assignment, asking for extra help when you need it,
				spending the time to study for tests and quizzes, recognizing weaknesses, and looking for ways to
				improve.
			<h2> They're Involved </h2>
			<p> Being involved in extra-curricular activities can help a student gain confidence, which can improve
				academic success. Most schools provide a plethora of extracurricular activities that students can
				participate in. Most good students get involved in some activity whether it is athletics, Future Farmers
				of America, or student council. These activities provide so many learning opportunities that a
				traditional classroom simply can’t. These activities also provide opportunities to take on leadership
				roles and they often teach people to work together as a team to accomplish a common goal.
			<h2> They're Leaders </h2>
			<p> Teachers love good students who are natural leaders within their classroom. Whole classes have their own
				unique personalities and often those classes with good leaders are good classes. Likewise, those classes
				that lack peer leadership can be the most difficult to handle. Leadership skills are often innate. There
				are those who have it and those who don’t. It is also a skill that develops over time amongst your
				peers. Being trustworthy is a key component of being a leader. If your classmates don’t trust you, then
				you won't be a leader. If you are a leader amongst your peers, you have the responsibility to lead by
				example and the ultimate power to motivate others to be successful.
			<h2> They're Motivated </h2>
			<img src="./resources/student.png" style="width:300px;height:300px;margin:10px" />
			<p> Motivation comes from many places. The best students are the ones who are motivated to be successful.
				Likewise, students who lack motivation are the ones who are the hardest to reach, are often in trouble,
				and eventually, drop out of school.
			<p> Students who are motivated to learn are easy to teach. They want to be at school, want to learn, and
				want to succeed. Motivation means different things to different people. There are very few people that
				aren’t motivated by something. Good teachers will figure out how to motivate most students in some way,
				but those students who are self-motivated are far easier to reach than those who aren’t.
			<h2> They're Problem Solvers </h2>
			<p> No skill is lacking more than that of the ability to be a problem solver. With the Common Core state
				standards requiring students to be adept at problem-solving, this is a serious skill that schools have
				to work extensively at developing. Students who possess true problem-solving skills are few and far
				between in this generation largely because of the accessibility that they have to information
			<p> Those students who do possess true problem-solving abilities are rare gems that teachers love. They can
				be used as a resource to help develop other students into becoming problem solvers.
			<h2> They Seize Opportunities </h2>
			<p> One of the greatest opportunities in the U.S. is that every child has free and public education.
				Unfortunately, not every person takes full advantage of that opportunity. It is true that every student
				must attend school for some period of time, but that doesn’t mean that every student seizes that
				opportunity and maximizes their learning potential.
			<p> The opportunity to learn is undervalued in the United States. Some parents don’t see value in education
				and that's passed on to their children. It is a sad reality that is often overlooked in the school
				reform movement. The best students take advantage of the opportunities they are afforded and value the
				education they receive.
			<h2> They're Solid Citizens </h2>
			<p> Teachers will tell you that classes full of students who follow the rules and procedures have a better
				chance of maximizing their learning potential. Students who are well behaved are likely to learn more
				than their counterparts who become student discipline statistics. There are plenty of smart students who
				are discipline problems. In fact, those students are often the source of ultimate frustration for
				teachers because they will likely never maximize their intelligence unless they choose to change their
				behavior.
			<p> Students who are well behaved in class are easy for teachers to deal with, even if they struggle
				academically. Nobody wants to work with a student who constantly causes problems, but teachers will try
				to move mountains for students who are polite, respectful, and follow the rules.
			<h2> They Have a Support System </h2>
			<p> Unfortunately, this quality is one that individual students often have very little control over. You
				cannot control who your parents or guardians are. It is also important to note that there are plenty of
				successful people who did not have a good support system growing up. It is something that you can
				overcome, but it does make it a lot easier if you have a healthy support system in place.
			<p> These are people that have your best interest in mind. They push you to success, offer advice, and guide
				and direct your decisions throughout your life. In school, they attend parent/teacher conferences, make
				sure your homework is done, require you to have good grades, and generally motivate you to set and reach
				academic goals. They are there for you in times of adversity and they cheer for you in times that you
				are successful. Having a great support system doesn’t make or break you as a student, but it definitely
				gives you an advantage.
			<h2> They're Trustworthy </h2>
			<p> Being trustworthy is a quality that will endear you not only to your teachers but also to your
				classmates. No one wants to surround themselves with people whom they ultimately cannot trust. Teachers
				love students and classes that they trust because they can give them liberties that often provide
				learning opportunities they would not be afforded otherwise.
			<p id="jj">For example, if a teacher had an opportunity to take a group of students to listen to a speech by
				the president of the United States, the teacher may turn the opportunity down if the class is not
				trustworthy. When a teacher gives you an opportunity, she is putting faith into you that you are
				trustworthy enough to handle that opportunity. Good students value opportunities to prove that they are
				trustworthy.
