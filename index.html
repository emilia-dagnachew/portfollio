			<h1 style="font-family:Snell Roundhand, cursive;"> The Characteristics of a Good School </h1>
			<div id="link"><a href="https://www.twitter.com/terryheick"> By: Terry Heick </a> </div>
			<p> When a society changes, so then must its tools.
			<p> Definitions of purpose and quality must also be revised continuously. What should a school ‘do’? Be? How
				can we tell a good school from a bad one?
			<p> This really starts at the human level but that’s a broader issue. For now, let’s consider that schools
				are simply pieces of larger ecologies. The most immediate ecologies they participate in are human and
				cultural. As pieces in (human) ecologies, when one thing changes, everything else does as well. When it
				rains, the streams flood, the meadows are damp, the clovers bloom, and the bees bustle. When there’s
				drought, things are dry, and stale, and still.
			<p> When technology changes, it impacts the kinds of things we want and need. Updates to technology change
				what we desire; as we desire new things, technology changes to seek to provide them. The same goes
				for–or should go for–education. Consider a few of the key ideas in progressive education. Mobile
				learning,
				<a href=https://www.teachthought.com> examples of digital citizenship, </a> design thinking,
				collaboration, creativity, and on a larger scale, digital literacy,1:1, and more are skills and content
				bits that every student would benefit from exposure to and mastery of. As these force their way into
				schools and classrooms and assignments and the design thinking of teachers, this is at the cost of ‘the
				way things were.’
			<p> When these ‘things’ are forced in with little adjustment elsewhere, the authenticity of everything dies.
				The ecology itself is at risk.
			<h3 style="font-family:Snell Roundhand, cursive;"> The Purposes of School in an Era of Change </h3>
			<p> What should schools teach, and how? And how do we know if we’re doing it well? These are astoundingly
				important questions–ones that must be answered with social needs, teacher gifts, and technology access
				in mind. Now, we take the opposite approach. Here’s what all students should know, now let’s figure out
				how we can use what we have to teach it. If we don’t see the issue in its full context, we’re settling
				for glimpses.
			<p> How schools are designed and what students learn–and why–must be reviewed, scrutinized, and refined as
				closely and with as much enthusiasm as we do the gas mileage of our cars, the downloads speeds of our
				phones and tablets, or the operating systems of our watches. Most modern academic standards take a
				body-of-knowledge approach to education. This, to me, seems to be a dated approach to learning that
				continues to hamper our attempts to innovate.
			<p> Why can’t education, as a system, refashion itself as aggressively as the digital technology that is
				causing it so much angst? The fluidity of a given curriculum should at least match the fluidity of
				relevant modern knowledge demands. Maybe the first step in pursuit of an innovative and modern approach
				to teaching and learning might be to rethink the idea of curriculum as the core of learning models?
			<p> Less is more is one way to look at it, but that’s not new–power standards have been around for years. In
				fact, in this era of information access, smart clouds, and worsening socioeconomic disparity, we may
				want to consider whether we should be teaching content at all, or rather teaching students to think,
				design their own learning pathways, and create and do extraordinary things that are valuable to them in
				their place?
			<p> Previously we’ve assumed that would be the effect–that if students could read and write and do
				arithmetic and compose arguments and extract the main idea and otherwise master a (now nationalized)
				body of knowledge, that they’d learn to think and play with complex ideas and create incredible things
				and understand themselves in the process. That the more sound and full their knowledge background was,
				the greater the likelihood that they’ll create healthy self-identities and be tolerant of divergent
				thinking and do good work and act locally and think globally and create a better world.
			<p> A curriculum-first school design is based on the underlying assumption that if they know this and can do
				this, that this will be the result. Of course, it doesn’t always work out that way. Worse, we tend to
				celebrate school success instead of human success. We create ‘good schools’ that graduate scores of
				students with very little hope for the future. How crazy is that?

				<li>A good school is more concerned with cultural practices than pedagogical practices–students and

			<h2 style="text-align:center;font-family:Snell Roundhand, cursive;"> Are You Teaching Content, Or Teaching Thought? </h2>
			<h2> By: Terry Heick </h2>
			<p> Thinking is troublesome.
			<p> For one, it is an intimate act splicing time and space. It is done right here, but it spans moments in
				the pasts and reaches out uncertainly towards moments in the future. Put another way, you think in a
				singular, precise space about plural, imprecise times.
			<p> It also resists uniformity (and education loves uniformity). Thought hinges on schema (familiar forms
				and patterns we then impose unfamiliar data to make sense of it), and emotion (in part, our internal
				response to the former). It is as diverse as character, experience, and affection. It’s like defining
				art, establishing criteria for beauty, or causing love
			<p> And whether it knows it or not, education has a thinking problem.
			<h2> The Nature of Thinking </h2>
			<p> Part of it is due to thinking’s oily skin. What does it mean to understand, show curiosity, or think? We
				have tests to try to measure, but the assessment of thought isn’t the priority, but rather grasp of
				content–and this is another problem.
			<p> priority
			<p> One common response is to choose a handful of actions that indicate thinking–‘power verbs’–that we hang
				on the wall. We then form short response questions asking students to ‘Analyze,’ and ‘Evaluate,’ and
				feel bloody well that we’re rigorous.
			<p> But in this circumstance is thinking useful, or critical? Think about the fact that we promote ‘thinking
				strategies,’ which makes as much sense as a five-star restaurant promoting “cooking strategies.”
			<p> Shouldn’t a school fail to function without urgent and divergent thinking? Shouldn’t a classroom fall
				flat on its face when it’s not there? The way education is currently designed, the answer is no. We
				reteach, intervene, and remediate. Einstein’s definition of insanity seems apt here.
			<p> If our job is to teach skills, facts, and concepts–crystallized intelligence–then thinking is simply a
				tool, and our curriculum is content.
			<p> If our job is to teach critical thinking, design, and problem-solving–fluid intelligence–then thinking
				is our collective circumstance, and our curriculum becomes thought.
			<p> So, which is it
			<h2 style="text-align:center"> If Curriculum Is Content </h2>
			<p> As an industry, our collective performance is far too mediocre to dabble here and there. When we make
				content proficiency our goal, all of our resources are applied there. Every unit we plan. Every
				walkthrough observation. Every PLC meeting we attend. Every PD we have the pleasure of experiencing.
				Every piece of technology we buy. Every grant we write.
			<p> We align everything in pursuit of that goal.
			<p>If our curriculum remains content, then we simply need to decide what our terms of success are, and
				continue to experiment until we turn all the little bar graphs that display all the data from all the
				assessments from red and yellow to green and blue. Or change our terms for success–new cut scores,
				softer assessments, etc.
			<p> Either way, critical thinking is necessarily secondary–a pathway rather than a destination or
				playground. And that’s okay as long as we’re on the same page here. As long as that’s what we want.
			<p> But if our curriculum is thinking–if our job is to, excuse the convenient phrasing, teach thought–then
				the classroom floor beneath us tilts right and then left, and our goals as educators change in important
				ways.
			<p> To learn to think, students need powerful and inspiring models that reflect the design, citizenship,
				creativity, interdependence, affection, and self-awareness we claim to want them to have.
			<p>To teach careful, creative, and truly innovative thinking, students need creative spaces and tools, and
				frameworks to develop their own criteria for quality and success.
			<p>They need dynamic literacy skills that they practice and build upon endlessly.
			<p>Not projects that have creativity and design thinking added on, but projects that can’t function without
				them.
			<p>And they need control of it all.
			<p>Units–if we use them–aren’t planned backwards from standards, but thinking habits, self-direction, and
				intellectual urgency. If our curriculum is content, these are simply a means to a different end. Not
				priorities, but feel good phrasing we add to school mission statements and casually drop in parent
				conferences.
			<p>As teachers, we have an intimidating–borderline overwhelming–index of academic standards that every
				student needs to master. But as both an industry and a culture, we complain that students ‘can’t think
				for themselves.’
			<p>So which is it–should we teach content, or teach students how to think? This isn’t a false dichotomy; we
				can teach both thinking and traditional curriculum–teach one through the other–but it just might be that
				we’re trying to serve two masters and failing both.
